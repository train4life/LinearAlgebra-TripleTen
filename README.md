# Project: Sure Tomorrow Insurance Machine Learning Evaluation

Overview:
Welcome to the Sure Tomorrow Insurance Machine Learning Evaluation project! In this repository, you'll find the code and resources to address four key tasks outlined by the insurance company. These tasks involve customer similarity identification, insurance benefit prediction, linear regression modeling, and implementing data masking to protect clients' personal data.

Objectives:
The main objectives of this project are to evaluate the feasibility of using machine learning to solve the specified tasks, address each task with appropriate techniques, and ensure data privacy while maintaining model quality.

Instructions:

Step 1: Load and Inspect the Data

Load the dataset insurance_us.csv provided by Sure Tomorrow Insurance.
Step 2: Data Quality Check

Ensured the dataset is free from missing values and extreme values.

Task 1: Find Similar Customers

Developed a customer similarity model for marketing assistance.
Assisted agents by identifying customers similar to a given customer.

Task 2: Insurance Benefit Prediction

Built a prediction model to determine if a new customer is likely to receive insurance benefits.
Compared models performance with a dummy model to assess its effectiveness.

Task 3: Predicted Number of Insurance Benefits

Used linear regression to predict the number of insurance benefits for new customers.

Task 4: Data Masking for Privacy

Developed a data transformation algorithm to obfuscate personal data.
Ensured privacy protection without compromising model quality.
